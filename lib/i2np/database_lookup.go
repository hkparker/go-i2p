key ::

                           request came from (to which the reply should be
                           sent)
     if deliveryFlag == 1, the SHA256 hash of the reply tunnel gateway (to
                           which the reply should be sent)

flags ::
     1 byte
     bit order: 76543210
     bit 0: deliveryFlag
             0  => send reply directly
             1  => send reply to some tunnel
     bit 1: encryptionFlag
             through release 0.9.5, must be set to 0

                    with version 0.9.16 or higher.

             future uses and with older routers

reply_tunnelId ::
               4 byte TunnelID
               only included if deliveryFlag == 1
               tunnelId of the tunnel to send the reply to

size ::
     2 byte Integer
     valid range: 0-512
     number of peers to exclude from the DatabaseSearchReplyMessage

excludedPeers ::
              $size SHA256 hashes of 32 bytes each (total $size*32 bytes)
              if the lookup fails, these peers are requested to be excluded
              from the list in the DatabaseSearchReplyMessage.
              if excludedPeers includes a hash of all zeroes, the request is
              exploratory, and the DatabaseSearchReplyMessage is requested
              to list non-floodfill routers only.

reply_key ::
     32 byte SessionKey
     only included if encryptionFlag == 1, only as of release 0.9.7

tags ::
     1 byte Integer
     valid range: 1-32 (typically 1)
     the number of reply tags that follow
     only included if encryptionFlag == 1, only as of release 0.9.7

reply_tags ::
     one or more 32 byte SessionTags (typically one)
     only included if encryptionFlag == 1, only as of release 0.9.7
